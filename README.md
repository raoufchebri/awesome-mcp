## 🌐 What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized way to let AI agents (like Cursor Agent and Composer) interact with external systems — including project management tools, code repositories, file storage, databases, and observability platforms. With MCP, your agent can:

- Search files and databases
- Fetch real-time project data
- Execute queries
- Read error reports, logs, and even automate browser interactions
